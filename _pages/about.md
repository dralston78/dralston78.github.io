I'm a second year mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Santa Barbara.  Previously, I studied mathematics at [Bowdoin College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowdoin_College) and minored in English.  I am currently narrowing my research intrests between probability theory and dimension reduction, although I also have tangental intrests in toplogy.  In general, I love puzzles and problem solving.  In my free time I enjoy [distance running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/68004667), [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/68004667), and surfing.  I am also a licensed private pilot.  

A copy of my resume is [here](assets/pdf/resume_8-29.pdf).
